This folder contains microSD card SDIO communication related projects.

The overarching goal is to learn how to communicate with the microSD card using SDIO
 SDIO is supposed to be faster
 It is also a new protocol to practice learning versus SPI which I learned prior with the PMOD 0.96 inch LCD screen

Once I have learned how to read and write data to and from this microSD card correctly multiple future projects will become easier

In order to fully emulate the nintendo GBA or even nintendo DS I will need a lot of storage space which is where microSD and SDIO come in handy.
 I will store image data and audio data on this microSD card.

I will need to dive deeper into both video and audio but that will come together behind the scenes (in parallel)
