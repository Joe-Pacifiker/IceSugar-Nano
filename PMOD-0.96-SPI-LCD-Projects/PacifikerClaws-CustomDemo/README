This project will write to the PMOD 0.96 LCD screen a customized image.

I have discovered that based on the optimized demo example each block of ram has 4Kb.
So, when I am only using 21 bytes give or take I am underutilizing the RAM.

My goal now knowing this information is to fully utilize the block ram that I am using.
Starting with just 1 block of ram and working my way up to all 16 blocks available.
