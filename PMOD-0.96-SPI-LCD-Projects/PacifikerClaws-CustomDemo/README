In this custom demo I will display Pacifiker Claws provided image onto the lefthand side of the PMOD-0.96-LCD screen.

First I will review the provided ST7735 documentation to ensure that I properly initialize the LCD screen.
My goal is to perform the bare minimum initialization necessary to display my image.

**** Update as of January 3rd, 2024: 
 I have discovered recently that the ST7735S driver is more likely to be the correct driver due to PWCTR having 3 parameters versus 2.
 Currently I have a working initialized demo program to build this project with.
 The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of how CASET/RASET work in the placement of partial frames.

I will also try to provide the shortest delays for lcd parameters and commands to maximize the efficiency in the displayment of frames.
 I am still working on correcting optimization of delays.

**** Update as of January 8th, 2024:
 I created a python script to generate bram block initialization statements to initialize 7600 bytes of pixel data for the partial frame
  to be displayed to the screen. 
 This approach was tried since $readmemh system task is not available in synthesis since it is a PLI system task.
 After building it resulted in consuming over 800% LUT avaiable space!
 So, I am currently reviewing how Yosys is determining the difference between BRAM and LUTs.
 My next idea for this project is to use an external storage media (microSD card) for picture data.
