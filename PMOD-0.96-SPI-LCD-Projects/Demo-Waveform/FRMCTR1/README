Send command FRMCTR1 to ST7735 LCD Driver.

I will soon debug the parameters section.
After that I will move from 1 cmd sent to n commands sent.

This with provide the next level of robustness.
I plan to have several levels of robustness in order to make frames easier to change and send to LCD screen.
