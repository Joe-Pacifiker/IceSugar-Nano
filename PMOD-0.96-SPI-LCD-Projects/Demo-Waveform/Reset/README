PMOD 0.96 LCD Reset command implementation for IceSugarNano FPGA based on ST7735 documentation.

The provided documentation states that reset signal needs to be active for at least 10us,
 and deactivated for at least 5ms

Given the default clock frequency is 12Mhz that would mean that active reset should take 120 clock cycles
 and deactivated reset should take 60000 clock cycles (12 * 10 * 500)

This example defines a few Reset states that will be used going forward and possibly modified...
