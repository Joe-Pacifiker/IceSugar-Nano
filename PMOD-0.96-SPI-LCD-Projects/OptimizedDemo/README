This project will attempt to optimize the PMOD 0.96 LCD demo program by removing unnecessary commands and/or shrinking delays when possible.

Final delay results and bare minimum commands in order to write the white frame will be provided here.

The current Optimized demo includes two separate BRAM blocks one for LCD cmds another for LCD paramaters.
 Originally the BRAM was not being recognized by nextpnr, so I decided to use separate modules like 'wuxx' did.
 I modified a version of his by removing the use of the write data feature, so in this case the BRAM is more like BROM

BRAM is still underutilized at this current time, I plan to fix that by ensuring that each memory block (4Kb) are
 completely full. That way there is no wasted data in the BRAM and I can use it all as I would expect to be able to.
