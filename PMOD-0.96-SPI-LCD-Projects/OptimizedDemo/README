This project will attempt to optimize the PMOD 0.96 LCD demo program by removing unnecessary commands and/or shrinking delays when possible.

Final delay results and bare minimum commands in order to write a frame will be provided here:

 List of delays that have been removed:
  - sleep [delay for sleep out booster on cmd]
  - pcmd [post cmd delay]
  - mw_c [memory write cmd delay]
  - mw_p [memory write parameter delay]
  - crg [CASET/RASET/GAMA delay]
  - frmctr3 [Frame Rate Control 3 delay]
  - gmctr [Gama control delay]
  - cr [CASET/RASET delay]
 List of cmds removed:
  - unnecessary CASET/RASET/RAMWR cmds
 Next Steps:
  - Optimize the BRAM, nextpnr log should display proper BRAM utilization
