This project will attempt to optimize the PMOD 0.96 LCD demo program by removing unnecessary commands and/or shrinking delays when possible.

Final delay results and bare minimum commands in order to write the white frame will be provided here:

Currently all delays from the demo example are not required in order to produce the white frame.
So optimization has resulted in significant speed up, the free up of a lot of FPGA LUTs, and elimination of unnecessary verilog code.

Next I will analyze the LCD commands to see which commands are not necessary to achieve white frame, those will be provided here:

The majority of the lcd commands are necessary to fully initialize the screen.
With the exception of the first set of incorrectly defined CASET/RASET/RAMWR commands
 CASET and RASET should have been swapped, and RAMWR should have been provided data.

With this being analyzed I will eventually go through each initialization command and try different modes at a later date.
