This project will interface with the 1.44inch LCD HAT used with the Raspberry Pi Zero.

This LCD has 128x128 Resolution, and uses the ST7735S LCD Controller.

This project will be far easier in my view since the icesugar-nano pmod lcd screen did not have clear enough information for development.

This project will go deeply into how to interface clearly with the LCD Controller, and how this controller works.

The pin layout will be clearly drawn out with schematic and each wire will be color coded and labelled.

The first project I will do is to initialize all data/commands to the LCD and provide a brief video of the initialization steps.

My hope is that anyone who is intriqued by SPI TFT Displays can view this project to confirm their own hardware verification for FPGA development with LCD screens.
Early on with this project I found it difficult to tell if any of my commands were working properly since through deep research I was not able to find
 precise documentation/video of what each command looks like when properly sent and recieved to the LCD screen.
